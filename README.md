This is a simple todo list that i create to use while i'm working on [Stefanini](https://stefanini.com/en).

Part of my job is to delivery computers and/or to do rollout -change old machines for a new ones. In this process, there's several steps to follow and this can be a little confuse, even to the oldests one.

So, my goal is an increase to the accuracity to me and who wants to use it, during our job. Helping to don't forgot any step and providing a few more stuffs as a copy/paste funcionality in some softwares instalation process.

I decide to use Next.Js so I cam use vercel to store it without complications and use react wit and API server integrated. However, I don't know if i will really need it.

## Deploy

I'm working on this project yet, but i will put it online on Vercel, so my partners cam follow as it grows up and give me their opinions about that.
